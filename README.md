# Main Idea:
Basically, we have a database (or list of foods from Berkeley restaurants) 


We will randomly output a picture of one of the foods, and there will be regenerate button to output a new picture

There is a textbox for the user to guess which restaurant the food is from, and if it doesnâ€™t match the correct restaurant, the user gets a hint
